# gimeo
This is a Go library to consume the Vimeo API. More information on the API can be found on the [official page](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/start).

## Installation
All you need to do is run:
```
go get https://github.com/julianedialkova/gimeo.git
```
Then you can enjoy the library!

## Using the library

### First steps
In order to make requests to the API you must first run the following function:

```
var client = Vimeo("clientID", "clientSecret", "accessToken")
```

You should provide your client ID and secret. They can be found on your app page under the Authentication tab. You can create an app [here](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps).

You can also provide an access token, but it is optional. It is required in order to make requests. Below you can find information how to generate one.

### Generate an access token

There are two ways to make requests to the Vimeo API - through authenticated and unauthenticated tokens. First you should have called the Vimeo function to generate a client.

1. Unauthenticated token

  This is a token without a user. All you can see using this token is public data. If you want to generate one, just use:

  ```
  client.GenerateUnauthAccessToken([]string{"create"})
  ```
  Where scopes look like this: `[]string{"public"}`.

  As an argument you should pass the scopes you want to access. Description of the scopes can be found on the [official page](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/authentication#scopes).

1. Authenticated token

  This token uses the user. It interacts on behalf of the authenticated user. In order to generate one, you should:

  GenerateAuthAccessToken is the first step of the redirect process is to send the user's client (browser) to vimeo.com. This is generally accomplished by providing the authorize url as a link on a webpage.

    ```
    client.Generate–êuthAccessToken("redirectURI", scopes, "state")
    ```
    Where scopes look like this: `[]string{"public"}`.

|  Name         |  Description
|--------------|-------------
|  redirectURI  | This must be required, and must match your app callback URL
|  state        | A unique value which the client will return alongside access tokens

  If the user accepts your app, they are redirected to your redirect_uri along with two parameters.

|  Name         |  Description
|--------------|-------------
|  code        | A string token you must exchange for your access token
|  state       |The state you provided earlier. You must validate that this matches your original state. If the state does not match, you should not attempt to exchange the authorization code.

When the user returns to your site, you must exchange the code for your access token. Make an HTTP POST request to https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/access_token with your authorization header, and the following parameters.


    ```
    client.GetToken("code", "redirectURI")
    ```

### Make a request
When you have all ready making a request is really simple:

```
params := &Parameters{
	"per_page": 10,
 }

 client.GetMyAlbums(params)
```


### Upload a video
You may also upload a video.

1. Upload a video
  ```
  params := &Parameters{
	 	"type": "streaming",
	 }
  client.Upload("/path/to/video.mp4")
  ```
